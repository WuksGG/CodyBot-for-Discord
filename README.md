# CodyBot, but for Discord!
CodyBot is a Discord bot, coded specifically with Galvanize's Hack Reactor bootcamp students in mind. This project takes inspiration from a beloved Slack bot by  the same name that sends consistent reminders of events on the day's schedule; we can't be forgetting lunches and dinners!\
\
Extending from Slack's codybot's primative notifications, CodyBot for Discord's reminders also contain the meeting links when applicable for easy access to Zoom rooms. CodyBot for Discord's main feature, however, is that it's for Discord and not for Slack; and we certainly are fans of Discord.
