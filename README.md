# CodyBot, but for Discord!
CodyBot is a Discord bot, coded specifically with Galvanize's Hack Reactor bootcamp students in mind. This project takes inspiration from a beloved Slack bot by  the same name that sends consistent reminders of events on the day's schedule; we can't be forgetting lunch and dinner!\
\
Aside from the only feature that Slack's codybot has, which is a simple notification that takes the format of `@channel 3 Minutes until ${event}.` and `@channel It's Time For Lunch`, CodyBot for Discord's reminders also contain the meeting links when applicable for easy access to Zoom rooms. However, CodyBot for Discord's main feature is, of course, that it's for Discord and not for Slack; and we are definitely fans of Discord.
